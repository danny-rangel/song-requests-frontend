This is the frontend for a Twitch extension I created called Song Requests. The Twitch extension can be used by streamers that perform music for their viewer audience. Features include personal song lists for streamers, live queue feed, and personal settings for added flexibility.

Front end was created using React. Data was queried and managed with Apollo Client, using the new React hooks that they just came out with. Styled with Material UI React and Styled Components.
