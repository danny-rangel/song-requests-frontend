Viewers can then view your song list and request a song that will get added to your queue! You can then remove songs from your queue as you perform them or clear the queue altogether. By default, a viewer can only request one song at a time, but you can change that to allow multiple songs from one viewer. You are also able to close the queue at any point if your list is getting too long! Support for bits enabled requests and sub only mode coming soon!",
